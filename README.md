# Hash Tables Presentation

This repository gives a very brief implementation example of hash tables.

In this particular case I created only a closed addressing hash table implementation
using chaining with a linked list created only for educational purposes.

The demo shows the result after inserting a number of elements.

## Usage
* $`git clone https://github.com/davidvartanian/hash-tables-presentation.git`
* $`python hash_table.py`
